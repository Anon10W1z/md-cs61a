# Scheme Basics

With the Python aspect of 61A (as well as your very first midterm!) out of the way, it's time to take what you've learned about programming languages and apply it to a new one. Scheme is a dialect of the Lisp language, which becomes very useful in applications such as Natural Language Processing. It may seem daunting, but you'll find that it's not too bad once you understand how the fundamentals of Python extend to Scheme.
