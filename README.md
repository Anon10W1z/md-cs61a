# Guide to CS 61A [WIP]

UC Berkeley's CS 61A is one of the most widely known introductory Computer Science courses, but it's also one of the most challenging, especially for new programmers. When I took the class as a freshman, I realized that everyone came from a different programming background, meaning many people needed more guidance and a slower pace than the course could offer. To help make sure everyone was getting the help they needed, I helped out whoever asked while I took the course, and that became the primary motivation for this guide.

## About This Guide
In a sort of circular manner, I'll save some space and simply link you to the [about page](https://cs61a.imvs.me/welcome/guide/) on the website, which should give you a pretty good idea of what I hope to accomplish by creating this guide. That about page, however, was written before I decided to make this guide open source, so it may not reflect the intention of getting as many perspectives and examples and teaching methods as possible.

## Viewing This Guide
The best way to view this guide would be via the hosted website, which formats and orders the content on here in an easy-to-read fashion. The second-best way to view this guide is to read it here, which you're welcome to do if that's what you prefer!

## Contributing
This is probably the reason you're here in the first place. And I'm glad you are, because you're going to help make this guide that much better. Contributing is easy!
1. Fork this repo. The only thing here is content, so keeping your fork updated shouldn't be too incredibly complex.
2. Make your changes. Fix an issue, add some examples or clarifying content, write your own page, or create a whole new week's worth of material. How much you want to contribute is up to you!
3. Submit a PR. More on this later.
4. Wait (not too long) until I merge your pull, and your contribution(s) go(es) live.

This project more or less *just* started, so expect a lot of kinks to be ironed out. If you have any pressing concerns, feel free to submit an issue, or contact me some other way. Looking forward to making this much more concrete and hopefully, with your help, writing an amazing guide for future students to benefit from!
