We've covered the basics, and it's time to get into it. Let's go ahead and install Python to get ourselves going.

## Lab 0
The course staff has done an incredible job in writing [Lab 0](https://cs61a.org/lab/lab00/), which guides you through the process of installing Python and also introduces you to the very basics of the language. I encourage you to follow the instructions in this lab to get up and running.
