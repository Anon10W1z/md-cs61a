# Object-Oriented Programming

Data abstraction is helpful, but it's kind of hard to keep track of what's a regular function and what's part of an abstraction. Plus, they're kind of hard to use on a large scale, especially if your code is split into multiple files. Fortunately, data abstraction was just an introduction to what most CS is about these days -- object-oriented programming!
